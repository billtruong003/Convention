# Project Conventions

This project follows specific conventions to maintain code quality, readability, and organization. Below are the four key conventions that we adhere to:

## 1. **Python Naming Conventions**

For Python code, we follow the guidelines outlined in PEP 8 for naming conventions. This ensures consistency and clarity throughout the project.

- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Methods and Variables: `snake_case`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

For more details, refer to [Python Naming Conventions](./Python Convention.md).

## 2. **C# Naming Conventions**

For C# code, we use the following guidelines:

- Classes and Methods: `PascalCase`
- Variables: `camelCase`
- Constants: `PascalCase` prefixed with `const`

For more details, refer to [C# Naming Conventions](./C# Convention.md).

## 3. **Comment Conventions**

We use descriptive comments to ensure the code is understandable. Specific tags like `TODO`, `FIXME`, `OPTIMIZE`, and `IMPORTANT` are used to mark important sections in the code. Each tag has a specific purpose.

For more details, refer to [Comment Conventions](./Comment Convention.md).

---

## 4. **Commit Message Conventions**

Our commit messages use symbols to denote the type of commit:

- `(Fix)`: For bug fixes or simple updates
- `(Add)`: For new features or files
- `(Remove)`: For deleting files or code
- `(Update)`: For updating functionality or files
- `(!)`: For breaking changes

For more details, refer to [Commit Message Conventions](./Commit Convention.md).

Maintaining these conventions helps ensure the project remains consistent, readable, and maintainable.
